# regen-site — agent brief

Marketing site for REGEN (iOS peptide tracking app). Next.js App Router,
all styling in `src/app/globals.css` (token-driven; never inline a hex or
spacing value that isn't declared in the token block at the top).

## Copy voice

Short, declarative, benefit-led. No em dashes anywhere in user-facing copy.
No hype adjectives ("world-class", "trusted", "revolutionary"). Concrete
nouns over abstractions: vials, doses, biomarkers, sources. Reference
register: "Run peptides with a clearer plan." / "Every vial, counted down" /
"Start without downloading anything."

## In-article CTA blocks (SEO articles: REQUIRED)

Every published blog article carries 1-2 `<PostCta>` blocks — a tinted card
with an app screenshot and one App Store button. When writing or publishing
a new post in `src/app/blog/[slug]/posts/`:

1. Import it after the types import:
   `import PostCta from "../PostCta";`
2. Place the FIRST block immediately before the third content `<h2>` (after
   the second section). Posts with fewer than 4 sections: before the second.
3. Posts with 5+ content sections also get a SECOND block, with a different
   variant, immediately before `<h2 id="faq">` (or before the last content
   h2 if the post has no FAQ).
4. Indent 6 spaces like sibling h2s, one blank line above and below:
   `      <PostCta variant="labs" />`

Pick the variant whose screen matches the surrounding section's topic:

| variant    | screenshot                        | shows                                   | use for sections about |
|------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------|
| `protocol` | `/screens/screen-home.png`        | next-dose countdown, day's nutrition    | dosing schedules, titration, timing, stacking |
| `labs`     | `/screens/screen-biomarker.png`   | Vitamin D highlight vs last panel       | bloodwork, biomarkers, trial outcomes, measured effects |
| `ai`       | `/screens/screen-ai.png`          | REGEN AI answering with citations       | mechanisms, evidence review, research claims |
| `vials`    | `/screens/screen-inventory.png`   | activity stats, compound inventory list | reconstitution, storage, expiry, vial handling |

`/screens/screen-meal.png` (nutrition logging) exists but has no variant
yet; add one to `src/app/blog/[slug]/PostCta.tsx` before referencing it.
New variants need: img, alt, title, one-sentence body (no em dashes), and a
`post_cta_*` analytics location string.

## Publishing checklist for SEO posts

- Post file in `src/app/blog/[slug]/posts/`, registered in `posts/index.ts`,
  listed in `src/app/lib/blogData.ts` (its excerpt feeds `/llms.txt`).
- 1-2 PostCta blocks per the rules above.
- Body links to other posts and to `/tools/reconstitution` where relevant.
- Verify with `npx tsc --noEmit` before opening the PR.
